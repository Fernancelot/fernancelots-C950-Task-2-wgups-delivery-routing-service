### A. Hash Table

Develop a hash table, without using any additional libraries or classes, that includes an insertion function to take the package ID as input and insert the following data components into the hash table:

- Delivery address
- Delivery deadline
- Delivery city
- Delivery zip code
- Package weight
- Delivery status (e.g., at the hub, en route, or delivered), including the delivery time

**Requirements:**
- Implement the HashTable data structure as part of your solution.
- Use dictionaries or other built-in data structures where needed.
- Only use the `CSV` and `DateTime` Python libraries.

**Provide a screenshot of your HashTable.**

---

### B. Look-Up Functions

Develop a look-up function that takes the package ID as input and returns the corresponding data components:

- Delivery address
- Delivery deadline
- Delivery city
- Delivery zip code
- Package weight
- Delivery status (e.g., at the hub, en route, or delivered), including the delivery time

**Provide a screenshot of your Look-Up function.**

---

### C. Original Code

Write an original program that delivers all packages and meets all requirements using the supporting documents:
- *addresses.csv*
- *distance.csv*
- *packages.csv*

#### C1. Identification Information

1. Include an identifying comment within the first line of the file named `main.py` with your student ID.

**Provide a `main.py` screenshot showing your Student ID.**

#### C2. Process and Flow Comments

2. Add comments to your code explaining the process and flow of the program.
   - Explain the intent and decisions for each major block of code.
   - Provide additional details for unusual or complex processes.

**Provide screenshots of commented code blocks.**

---

### D. Interface

Provide an intuitive user interface to:

- View the delivery status (including delivery time) of any package at any time.
- Display the total mileage traveled by all trucks.

**Delivery Status Options:**
- `At the hub`
- `En route`
- `Delivered` (must include the delivery time)

**Provide an interface screenshot.**

#### D1. First Status Check

1. Show the status of all packages loaded onto each truck at a time between 8:35 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.

**Provide a screenshot.**

#### D2. Second Status Check

2. Show the status of all packages loaded onto each truck at a time between 9:35 a.m. and 10:25 a.m.

**Provide a screenshot.**

#### D3. Third Status Check

3. Show the status of all packages loaded onto each truck at a time between 12:03 p.m. and 1:12 p.m.

**Provide a screenshot.**

---

### E. Screenshot of Code Execution

Provide screenshots showing:

1. Successful completion of the code.
2. Total mileage traveled by all trucks.
3. Console output and project files for evaluator verification.

### F. Algorithm Analysis

#### F1. Strengths of the Chosen Algorithm

1. Justify the package delivery algorithm used in the solution.
2. Describe at least two strengths of the algorithm in 4-5 sentences.

#### F2. Verification of Algorithm

2. Verify that the algorithm meets all scenario requirements.

#### F3. Other Possible Algorithms

1. Identify two other algorithms that could meet the scenario requirements.

#### F3a. Algorithm Differences

2. Explain how the two identified algorithms differ from the chosen algorithm.

---

### G. Different Approach

Describe modifications you would make if completing this project again. Provide details of these changes.

---

### H. Verification of Data Structure

#### H1. Other Data Structures

1. Identify two additional data structures that could meet the scenario requirements.

#### H1a. Data Structure Differences

2. Explain how these data structures differ from the one used in the solution.

---

### I. Sources

Include all sources used in your solution. Example:

```
