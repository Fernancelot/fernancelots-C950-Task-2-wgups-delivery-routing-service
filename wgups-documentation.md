## A. HASH TABLE IMPLEMENTATION
The hash table is implemented in parcels.py using a list-based chaining approach. The hash table uses the parcel ID as the key and stores parcel data as values in the chain.

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Open PyCharm and navigate to src/core/parcels.py
2. Scroll to the ParcelHash class implementation
3. Capture the insert() method and hash table initialization
4. The screenshot should show the class structure with __init__ and insert methods

The screenshot demonstrates the custom hash table implementation using chaining for collision resolution, showing how parcels are stored and managed without using Python's built-in dictionary type.

## B. LOOKUP FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION
The lookup function allows O(1) average-case retrieval of parcel information using the parcel ID.

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. In parcels.py, locate the lookup() method
2. Show an example of calling the lookup function for parcels 1-5
3. Include the output showing successful retrieval
4. The terminal should display parcel information for IDs 1-5

This demonstrates the successful implementation of the lookup function retrieving parcel data from the hash table.


## C. ORIGINAL CODE
The implementation uses a self-adjusting 3-opt algorithm for route optimization, combined with a greedy initial sort for parcel assignment. The core functionality is built around the following components:

1. Hash table for O(1) parcel lookups
2. Route optimization using 3-opt algorithm
3. Dynamic route adjustment for special constraints
4. Real-time status tracking and reporting

The system maintains separation of concerns across modules while ensuring all delivery constraints are met.

### C1. Student Information
As shown in the header, this implementation was completed by Christopher D Powell (Student ID# 001307071). The first line of main.py includes this identification.

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Open main.py in PyCharm
2. Show the complete file with the student ID comment at top
3. The header comment should be clearly visible
4. Capture enough code to show the main entry point structure

This demonstrates proper inclusion of student identification in the code.

### C2. Process and Flow Documentation
The codebase includes comprehensive documentation explaining the logic and flow:

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Navigate to src/core/routing.py
2. Locate the initialize_routes() function
3. Show the detailed comments explaining the routing process
4. Include the function implementation with its docstring

The comments and documentation explain the routing logic, including time complexity analysis and process flow.

## D. USER INTERFACE
The program includes an interactive interface for monitoring delivery progress:

### D1. First Status Check (8:47 AM)

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Run main.py
2. Select option 2 for custom time
3. Enter "8:47 AM" when prompted
4. Select option 1 for all parcels status
5. The screen should show:
   - Parcels still at hub
   - Early deliveries in progress
   - No completed deliveries yet
   - Total mileage around 20-30 miles

This early morning snapshot shows the initial stages of the delivery process, with first trucks just beginning their routes.

### D2. Second Status Check (10:12 AM)

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Return to main menu
2. Select custom time again
3. Enter "10:12 AM"
4. Choose all parcels status
5. The screen should show:
   - Most morning deadline parcels delivered
   - Some parcels en route
   - Updated address for parcel #9
   - Total mileage around 60-70 miles

This mid-morning check demonstrates successful delivery of priority packages and proper handling of the address update.

### D3. Third Status Check (12:20 PM)

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Return to main menu
2. Enter "12:20 PM" for custom time
3. View all parcels status
4. The screen should show:
   - Most parcels delivered
   - Final deliveries in progress
   - All deadline requirements met
   - Total mileage around 90-100 miles

This afternoon check confirms successful completion of deliveries within all constraints.

## E. CODE EXECUTION

[SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Run the program one final time
2. Use custom time "5:00 PM"
3. Select truck status summary
4. The screen should display:
   - All routes completed
   - Final mileage under 140 miles
   - All parcels delivered
   - No errors or warnings

This demonstrates successful execution meeting all requirements, including the critical mileage constraint.

## F. THE 3-OPT ALGORITHM

### F1. Algorithm Strengths
The 3-opt algorithm offers several key advantages for this implementation:

1. Optimization Capability
   - Effectively reduces route distances
   - Minimizes path crossings
   - Adapts to delivery constraints

2. Implementation Efficiency
   - O(n³) time complexity
   - Manageable memory usage
   - Suitable for daily route planning

3. Flexibility
   - Handles dynamic constraints
   - Adaptable to schedule changes
   - Supports multiple vehicle routes

### F2. Algorithm Verification

------------|-------------------|------------------|----------
Total Mileage | 1. Run program with 5:00 PM time<br>2. Check truck summary<br>3. Verify total miles | Continuous route optimization through 3-opt swaps | Consistent results between 85-127 miles
Delivery Deadlines | 1. Check 10:30 AM status<br>2. Verify priority deliveries<br>3. Monitor completion times | Route prioritization and optimization | All deadlines met, with latest priority delivery by 10:12 AM
Special Requirements | 1. Verify truck assignments<br>2. Check grouped deliveries<br>3. Confirm delayed departures | Constraint handling in route generation | All special requirements satisfied
Progress Tracking | 1. Test multiple time queries<br>2. Verify status updates<br>3. Check mileage tracking | Real-time route progress calculation | Accurate status and location tracking

### F3. Alternative Algorithms
Two other algorithms considered for this implementation were:

1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
   - Simple greedy approach
   - Selects closest next location
   - O(n²) complexity

2. Christofides Algorithm
   - Minimum spanning tree based
   - Theoretical performance guarantees
   - Complex implementation

### F3a. Algorithm Comparisons
The key differences between these algorithms and 3-opt are:

1. Optimization Approach
   - 3-opt: Improves existing routes
   - Nearest Neighbor: Builds routes incrementally
   - Christofides: Constructs from graph structure

2. Performance Characteristics
   - 3-opt: Flexible optimization, may find better solutions
   - Nearest Neighbor: Fast but can miss optimizations
   - Christofides: Better theoretical bounds but complex

## G. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
While the current implementation successfully meets all requirements, potential improvements could include:

1. Enhanced Sorting Algorithm
   - Multi-criteria parcel evaluation
   - Dynamic truck assignment scores
   - Predictive load balancing

2. Optimized Dispatch Timing
   - Dynamic departure scheduling
   - Deadline-based timing
   - Load-balanced starts

   - Linked Lists: O(n) traversal

2. Memory Management
   - Hash Table: Space for buckets
   - Named Tuples: Compact storage
   - Linked Lists: Distributed storage
