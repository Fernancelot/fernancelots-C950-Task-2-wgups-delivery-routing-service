# WGUPS Route Optimization System
## Technical Documentation and Implementation Analysis

## 1. Implementation Overview

### 1.1 Development Environment
- Python 3.13.1
- JetBrains PyCharm 2024.1.4 Professional Edition
- Build #PY-241.18034.82 (April 2024)
- Runtime: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17.0.11+1-b1207.24

### 1.2 Core Components
The system consists of five main components:
1. Parcel Management System (parcels.py)
2. Route Optimization Engine (routing.py)
3. Location Management (locations.py)
4. Vehicle Fleet Control (trucks.py)
5. User Interface System (interface.py)

## 2. Data Structure Implementation

### 2.1 Hash Table Design
The parcel management system implements a custom hash table with the following characteristics:

```python
class ParcelHash:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 40
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]
        self.num_parcels = 0
        self.load_threshold = 1.5
```

Key Features:
- Chaining collision resolution
- Dynamic resizing at 150% load factor
- O(1) average-case operations
- No use of Python dictionaries

Performance Analysis:
- Insert Operation: O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Lookup Operation: O(1) average, O(n) worst
- Space Complexity: O(n)

### 2.2 Verification of Hash Table Implementation

| Operation | Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Insert | Add parcel #1 | Successful insertion | ✓ Passed |
| Lookup | Retrieve parcel #1 | Return correct parcel | ✓ Passed |
| Collision | Multiple parcels same hash | Proper chaining | ✓ Passed |
| Resize | Exceed load factor | Double table size | ✓ Passed |

## 3. Algorithm Analysis

### 3.1 Route Optimization Algorithm
The system implements the 3-opt algorithm for route optimization:

```python
def optimize_route_3opt(truck, distance_matrix, locations_list):
    # Initialize with hub location
    hub_idx = locations_list.index('4001 South 700 East')
    route_points = []
    
    # Map addresses to indices and optimize
    # [Implementation details...]
```

Key Characteristics:
- Time Complexity: O(n³)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Self-adjusting nature through continuous improvement
- Random initial route generation

### 3.2 Algorithm Effectiveness Analysis

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Total Distance | < 140 miles | 85-127 miles | Varies by run |
| Early Deadlines | 9:00 AM | Complete by 8:37 AM | Consistent |
| Mid Deadlines | 10:30 AM | Complete by 10:12 AM | Reliable |
| EOD Deliveries | 5:00 PM | Complete by 2:45 PM | Well within target |

### 3.3 Alternative Algorithms Considered

1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, O(n²) complexity
   - Cons: Often suboptimal solutions, less flexible
   
2. Christofides Algorithm
   - Pros: Guaranteed approximation ratio
   - Cons: More complex implementation, less adaptable

The 3-opt algorithm was chosen for:
- Better solution quality
- Flexibility with constraints
- Self-adjusting capability
- Reasonable implementation complexity

## 4. Constraint Management

### 4.1 Delivery Constraints
The system handles multiple types of delivery constraints:

1. Time Windows:
   ```python
   if not parcel.notes and parcel.deadline != EOD:
       if len(loads[1]) < 16:
           loads[1].append(parcel.parcel_id)
   ```

2. Package Groups:
   ```python
   if 'delivered with' in parcel.notes:
       group = parcel.notes[pointer:].split(', ')
       # Group processing logic
   ```

3. Vehicle Assignments:
   ```python
   if 'on truck' in parcel.notes:
       truck_num = int(parcel.notes.split()[-1])
       loads[truck_num].append(parcel.parcel_id)
   ```
